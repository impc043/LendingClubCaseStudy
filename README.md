## Project Understanding
- You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:</br>
    - If the applicant is ``likely to repay the loan`` then not approving --> loss of business.
    - If the applicant is ``not likely to repay the loan`` then approving --> loss of business.
